    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Niklaus Mikaelson is a lead character in the famous TV shows ‘The Vampire Diaries’ and ‘The Originals’ which was played by British actor Joseph Morgan. Niklaus Mikaelson is also commonly known as Klaus. He is an Original Vampire and an Original Hybrid (Vampire + Werewolf).Klaus is known as one of the most dreaded and merciless Villain of the series. Klaus first appeared in the second season of The Vampire Diaries and continued till the fourth season of the series, where he played an antagonist role and later got himself a show of his own called The Originals. Klaus was the biological son of Ansel and Esther Mikaelson, the step-son of Mikael. Klaus is the younger half-brother of Freya, Finn, Elijah, and the older half-brother of Kol, Rebekah and Henrik. Klaus is the father of Hope, whose mother is Hayley Marshall. For over a thousand years, Klaus had been trying to break a curse placed on him. He created the myth of the sun and moon curse in order to find the moonstone and the Petrova Doppelgänger, both of which were needed to break the actual curse. His goal was to liberate his werewolf side so he could sire his own super species of werewolf-vampire hybrids.</p>

<h3>Early History</h3>
<hr>
<p>Niklaus Mikaelson was born to Esther and Ansel in a small village that would eventually become known as Mystic Falls, but was raised by his step-father Mikael, both believing he was his true father. Mikael was inordinately hard on Klaus, having become an aggressive, violent, and strict man after he thought Freya died, always trying to teach his children to survive so he would not lose another child. In Klaus' case, Mikael was abusive to him for his impulsive and reckless behavior, justifying that his punishments would make Klaus stronger, but Mikael was only ever disappointed in everything Klaus did and beat him repeatedly throughout his mortal life.
  After becoming an Original Vampire and werewolf hybrid upon triggering his werewolf gene, his amplified temper and emotions, along with the psychological damage of Mikael's cruelty, turned Klaus into a violent and cruel person, much like his step-father Mikael.
  
  Once when Niklaus and his brother Henrik went to see the wolves transform, Henrik was killed by one of the transformed werewolves. Devastated at the loss of another child, Mikael convinced Esther to use her magic to protect their remaining children. Upon Mikael's request, Esther performed a spell, called The Immortality Spell, which transformed Niklaus, his siblings, and his step-father into Original Vampires, the first vampires to exist, and progenitors to the vampire species.

    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      While he was still an untriggered Werewolf-Witch hybrid, Klaus had a complicated life. He was close with his half-sister Rebekah, whom he affectionately called "Bekah", and with his half-brothers Elijah and Henrik. He also had a close relationship with his half-brother, Kol, but he did not get along at all with his half-brother, Finn, since childhood. However, he had a bad relationship with his overbearing step-father Mikael who was harder on him than any of his siblings. Elijah pointed out that as an untriggered werewolf, Klaus was so full of love and life, and that all he ever wanted was to be loved in return, especially by his step-father. This belief that no one loved him and that he was doomed to be alone forever was the main factor that changed Klaus' personality.
